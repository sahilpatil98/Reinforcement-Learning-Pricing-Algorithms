# Reinforcement-Learning-Pricing-Algorithms
Code for my Master's thesis studying early dynamics of RL pricing algorithms

The code follows the environment similar to that of Calvano et. al (2021) where two firms compete in a la Cournot in a stochastic setting with one period memory. 
These firms optimize lifetime profits and use a Q-learning mechanism to learn from interactions.
